            <p>Wearing a mask in areas where sufficient distance is not feasible,
               such as public transportation, most likely reduces the spread of virus-loaded
               droplets and therefore the risk of transferring SARS-CoV-2.
             They protect the person wearing them, as > 95% of particles and droplets are held back when inhaling.
            Masks with an exhaling valve let exhaled air pass out unfiltered, with contamination of the immediate environment. </p>

            <p>Handwashing has always been one of most effective ways of keeping diseases at bay.
               It is a simple act that pays in dividends when it comes to keeping ourselves healthy and safe.
                It is also one of the key cornerstones of COVID-19 prevention.
                Now more than ever as we embrace the new normal and live with COVID-19,
                hand hygiene needs to become an integral part of our daily routine and our lives, as we
                live through this pandemic,to protect us from diseases.</p>

<section class="spread" id="spread">

    <h1 class="heading">how Covid-19 <span>spreads</span> over the world</h1>
    <p class="spreading">The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated
      when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales.
      These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of
someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People
can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person
with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is
important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person
who is sick.
</p>
<p class="spreading"><b>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</b>
<br>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
  transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
  through the air. </p>
<p class="spreading"><b>
  Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</b>
  The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
  appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
  be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a
  main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
  COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
  this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
  after using the bathroom and before eating.</p>
<p class="spreading"><b>
  How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</b><br>
  The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
  there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
  For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
  still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
  areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
  these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
  and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
  case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
  restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
  disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
  COVID-19.
  COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
  has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
  new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
  situation where you are or intend to go.</p>
<p class="spreading"><b>
  Should I worry about COVID-19?</b><br>
Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for
children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about
1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite
normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will
affect them and their loved ones.
We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these
actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local
health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,
movement and gatherings.</p>

<p class="spreading"><b>
Who is at risk of developing severe illness</b><br>
While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,
older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or
diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.</p>

<p class="spreading"><b>
Should I wear mask to protect myself</b><br>
Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially
coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or
looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks
wisely.
We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary
wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most
effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to
frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from
people who are coughing or sneezing.</p>
<p class="spreading"><b>
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?</b><br>
While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong
Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can
transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets
produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To
protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID19 topics and will update as new findings are available.
